Discord bot code

This is simple Discord bot code
it's discord.js



This is what the bot code can do, it can do simple commands, and it can show status.
If you want more functionality you can go to [Discord.js Docs](https://discord.js.org) and you can add more.

**If you want to run/use it**
you will need to download node.js, *Download the most recent* [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/), and install it.
and to make your life easier please download Microsoft Visual Studios Code [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

then go ahead and click your windows key and type **cmd** and click enter
it should open a command prompt, do cd Desktop, then do mkdir code && cd code. then we will make one more folder do mkdir disbot && cd disbot.
do npm init and click enter for all, it will say is this ok? (yes) just click enter again.
do **code .** what that will do is open Visual Studios Code.
Now we will be installing the dependencies, to do this do npm install discord.js --save. if you see warn don't mind it's ok.
if you check Visual Studios Code there will be a new folder called node_modules, you won't need to mess with anything in there.

Before we go any further I need you to make a bot go to [Dev Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and make a bot

Now from here, you need to download the index.js and config.json and run.cmd
and put those in the disbot folder

**Config**
In config.json it says 
    "prefix": "!", "token": "!"


for prefix change it to what you want, or keep it default, the prefix is used so the bot knows you are talking to it.
for the token, you will take the token you see in bot in your app, replace the ! with your token.
then run the run.cmd and test it out. If it does not work dm on discord Jim Sim#3076
Thanks for reading through the documentation.
